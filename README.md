Science Mentorship Programme Codes

This repository contains the different codes used while developing an autotitrator using an Arduino

The main program, testing.ino is used to run an automated titrator, controlled by an Arduino R3 board. By linking an Excel Sheet to data log the pH detected and volume used, one can plot a graph and observe the pH changes throughout the titration process. This way, one can carry out weak acid-weak base titration, or any type of acid-base titrations, and observe for the volume where there is sharp decrease/increase in pH, which is known as the equivalence point and hence, calculate the concentration of the unknown titrand, or any other type of data where applicable that can be observed from the graph depending on the needs of the user. 

The Servo motor will be attached to the turning part of the burette

A magnetic stirrer is also required to mix the solution

2 infrared sensors will be needed, where the transmitter of one need to face the receiver of another, and they must be positioned such that each time the titrant in the burette come out drop by drop, the drop can be detected

The pH probe will go into the beaker containing the titrand of unknown concentration

This project was made possible with the help of my 2 other groupmates, Jun Jie and Samuel
